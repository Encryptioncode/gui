Gui of Encryption Code. Currently in development

- Start up and Main menu works.

# Accounts
- Originally, my plan was to store the account data in a database or server
  - Then the user could access their data from different devices
  - but the storing doesn't work, it makes you download the csv file
- So, my plan right now is to user local storage to store account data
  - however, this will only be accessible from one device, so the view from multiple devices part is out
